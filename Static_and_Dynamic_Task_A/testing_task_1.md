### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame


  def check_for_ace(card)
    if card.value = 1
    # should be == (seen after dynamic testing started)
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  # dif should be def
  # missing comma (seen after dynamic testing started)
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card
    # should return card1
  else
    return card2
  end
  # if statement is not indented
end
end

def self.cards_total(cards)
# method should be inside CardGame class
  total
  # needs to be set to 0 first (seen after dynamic testing started)
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
    # String should have a space at the end
    # Total needs to be converted to String (seen after dynamic testing started)
    # Return should be after the loop not within it (seen after dynamic testing started)
  end
end
